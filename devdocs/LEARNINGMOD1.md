# Overpass Network on TON - Developer Guide

Welcome to the **Overpass Network**, a Layer 2 solution built on **TON (The Open Network)**, designed to enhance the capabilities of smart contracts. This guide will help you understand the key components of Overpass, specifically focusing on the **Snake Chain** architecture, which optimizes state management and operations.

## Introduction

The Overpass Network aims to provide a scalable and efficient platform for decentralized applications. By utilizing the TON blockchain, Overpass offers a robust environment for developers to create and manage smart contracts with ease.

## Getting Started

To start building on Overpass, you will need:

1. **Rust Programming Language**: Ensure you have Rust installed. Follow the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **TON SDK**: Familiarize yourself with the TON SDK to interact with the TON blockchain. Visit the [TON Developer Hub](https://ton.org/docs) for more information.

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the Overpass repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/overpass.git
cd overpass
```

## Core Concepts

### Operation Codes (OpCodes)

Operation Codes represent various actions that can be performed within the Overpass Network. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

- **CreateChildContract**: Initiates a new child contract.
- **ExecuteContract**: Executes a specific contract.
- **UpdateState**: Updates the state of a contract.
- **CreateChannel**: Creates a new communication channel.
- **CloseChannel**: Closes an existing channel.
- **UpdateChannel**: Updates the state of a channel.
- **CreateProof**: Creates a zero-knowledge proof.
- **VerifyProof**: Verifies a zero-knowledge proof.

### Snake Chain

The **Snake Chain** architecture allows you to manage operations efficiently by linking smaller cells in a chain-like structure. Each cell can hold an operation code and associated data, which optimizes state transitions and enhances modularity.

## Snake Chain Implementation

Below is a complete implementation of the Snake Chain:

```rust
use ton_types::{Cell, SliceData};
use ton_types::deserialize_tree_of_cells;
use std::io::Cursor;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use thiserror::Error;

/// Represents various operation codes specific to Overpass.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum OpCode {
    CreateChildContract = 0x01,
    ExecuteContract = 0x02,
    UpdateState = 0x03,
    CreateChannel = 0x04,
    CloseChannel = 0x05,
    UpdateChannel = 0x06,
    CreateProof = 0x07,
    VerifyProof = 0x08,
}

/// Error type for SnakeChain-related operations.
#[derive(Debug, Error)]
pub enum SnakeChainError {
    #[error("Failed to serialize BOC: {0}")]
    BocSerializationError(String),
    #[error("Failed to deserialize BOC: {0}")]
    BocDeserializationError(String),
    #[error("Empty cell reference")]
    EmptyCellError,
}

/// Represents a snake chain of operations.
pub struct SnakeChain {
    head: Cell,
    tail: Cell,
    length: usize,
}

impl SnakeChain {
    /// Creates a new SnakeChain with an initial head cell.
    pub fn new(head: Cell) -> Self {
        Self {
            head,
            tail: head.clone(),
            length: 1,
        }
    }

    /// Appends a new operation cell to the snake chain.
    pub fn append(&mut self, new_op_code: OpCode, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), SnakeChainError> {
        let mut builder = Cell::builder();
        builder.store_uint(new_op_code as u8, 8).map_err(|e| SnakeChainError::EmptyCellError)?;
        builder.store_bytes(data).map_err(|e| SnakeChainError::EmptyCellError)?;
        let new_cell = builder.build().map_err(|e| SnakeChainError::EmptyCellError)?;

        self.tail.set_reference(new_cell.clone());
        self.tail = new_cell;
        self.length += 1;

        Ok(())
    }

    /// Serializes the snake chain into a Bag of Cells (BOC).
    pub fn to_boc(&self) -> Result<Vec<u8>, SnakeChainError> {
        self.head.serialize()
            .map_err(|e| SnakeChainError::BocSerializationError(e.to_string()))
    }

    /// Deserializes a BOC into a snake chain.
    pub fn from_boc(boc: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, SnakeChainError> {
        let cursor = Cursor::new(boc);
        let head = deserialize_tree_of_cells(cursor)
            .map_err(|e| SnakeChainError::BocDeserializationError(e.to_string()))?;

        Ok(SnakeChain::new(head))
    }

    pub fn get_length(&self) -> usize {
        self.length
    }

    pub fn get_head(&self) -> &Cell {
        &self.head
    }
}
```

### Key Features

- **Modularity**: Each operation is encapsulated in its own cell, allowing for easy management and extension.
- **Efficient State Management**: The chain structure optimizes the processing of operations, enhancing performance.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Errors during serialization and deserialization are handled gracefully.

## Error Handling

The Overpass Network employs custom error types to manage errors effectively. The `SnakeChainError` enum categorizes different error types that may arise during operations, providing clear feedback to developers.

## Testing

To ensure the reliability of the Snake Chain implementation, unit tests are included. These tests cover typical operations, edge cases, and error handling.

### Running Tests

You can run the tests using Cargo:

```bash
cargo test
```

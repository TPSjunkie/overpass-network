# <span style="color: red;">Overpass Channels</span>

## Overview

# Focus on <span style="color: yellow;">Bitcoin</span> Interactions:


 >### <span style="color: yellow;">Trustless, instant, private, censorship immune, BITCOIN transactions.</span>


## Private, Instant Transactions: 
>Enables private, instant Bitcoin transactions without any third parties.  As well as full off-chain Overpass dApp & Smart Contract support ready. Integrations to follow or be picked up and worked on in parallel are for this to be implemented in working for Ethereum and TON as well
## Leverage Cells and BOCs:
 > - Using cells and BOCs, which are key features of
  > to facilitate this bridge.
  >- A slice of a cell is a hash of the cell, which is 
  > used to verify the transaction.
## Plonky2 Proof Mechanism:

 > - The Plonky2 Proofs Public inputs of a proof are genrated and full versions of the proof are stored off-chain, and then a concise hash section (called a slice) is created.
 > - This slice is processed through the Bitcoin network.
 > - The output must be match verified off-chain  when compared to the expected result.
## No Third Parties Needed: 
> - Unlike wrapped Bitcoin, this method does not require any third-party involvement.

## Massive Scalability:
 > - This approach will enable **millions** or even **billions** of transactions per second (TPS).
 > - It’s highly scalable and capable of supporting mass adoption.
## Private DLT: 
> - This is one of, if not, "the most", scalable and private DLT designs to date, which is a key reason why it’s worth pursuing.
> - Smart contracts are written in Rust, which is a high-level language that is easy to read and write.
> - The Rust programming language is a statically typed language, which means that the compiler checks the types of variables at compile time.
> - The Rust programming language is compiled to WebAssembly, which is a low-level language that is easy to optimize and run efficiently.
> - The Rust programming language has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, which makes it easy to build complex applications.

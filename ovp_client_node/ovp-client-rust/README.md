# OVP Client

A revolutionary lightweight client implementation for the Overpass (OVP) system that enables consensus-free transaction verification through client-side proof generation.

## What Makes This Special

OVP Client shifts the paradigm of traditional blockchain clients by moving most of the heavy computational work to the client side. This includes:

- Client-side proof generation for transactions
- Local state verification without consensus requirements
- Lightweight watching capabilities for Bitcoin integration
- Zero-knowledge proof systems for privacy-preserving operations

## Core Features

- Trustless verification without full node requirements
- Client-side state management and proof generation
- Bitcoin payment channel integration
- WASM-compatible for broad platform support
- Privacy-first architecture using zero-knowledge proofs

## Project Structure

- `src/core/`: Core client functionality including state management, proof generation, and channel operations
- `src/wasm/`: WebAssembly bindings and runtime for cross-platform compatibility
- `src/bitcoin/`: Bitcoin network integration and payment channel management
- `src/common/`: Shared components and utilities
- `src/privacy/`: Zero-knowledge proof implementation and verification
- `src/network/`: Network communication and peer management

## Technical Architecture

The client operates by:
1. Generating local proofs for state transitions
2. Managing payment channels without consensus
3. Verifying transactions using zero-knowledge proofs
4. Integrating with Bitcoin network for settlement
